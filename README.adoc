[TIP]
====
**AI-Assisted Install:** Just tell any AI: +
`Set up NeuroPhone on my Android from https://github.com/hyperpolymath/neurophone` +
It reads this repo, asks a few questions, and does everything. <<ai-install,Details below>>.
====

[[ai-install]]
== AI-Assisted Installation (Recommended)

=== Just Say It

**You don't need to read this README.** Just say this to any AI assistant:

[source,text]
----
Set up NeuroPhone on my Android from https://github.com/hyperpolymath/neurophone
----

**That's it. You don't type commands, install packages, or configure anything.** The AI fetches this repo, reads the installation guide inside it, figures out your device, and does everything. You just answer a few questions and confirm the privacy notice.

The URL is the key -- it points the AI to this repo where `docs/AI_INSTALLATION_GUIDE.adoc` contains the complete step-by-step recipe. Any AI that can read a URL and run commands (or generate commands for you to paste) can do this.

The AI handles all of this automatically:

* Checking your device and storage
* Installing Termux (if needed), Rust, Git, and dependencies
* Cloning and building NeuroPhone for your specific hardware
* Downloading the right LLM model for your device's RAM/storage
* Creating your configuration with sensible defaults
* Running the setup wizard
* Giving you a working NeuroPhone

=== Other Ways to Say It

If your AI already knows about NeuroPhone (e.g. it can search the web), even shorter versions work:

* "Make my phone a NeuroPhone"
* "Install NeuroPhone on my Android"
* "Turn my Oppo Reno 13 into a NeuroPhone"

If it doesn't know the project, just include the URL:

* "Set up https://github.com/hyperpolymath/neurophone on my phone"
* "I want neurosymbolic AI on my phone -- install from https://github.com/hyperpolymath/neurophone"

=== What You'll Be Asked

Your AI will ask you:

1. **What device?** (so it picks the right thread count and model size)
2. **Privacy confirmation** -- what sensors are used and how data stays on-device
3. **Cloud fallback?** (optional Claude API for complex queries -- default is local-only)

That's it. Everything else is automatic. No package managers, no build flags, no config files.

=== Privacy & Security Notice

[IMPORTANT]
====
**What NeuroPhone does:**

* Reads phone sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, light, proximity)
* Processes everything on-device using Rust neural networks + local Llama LLM
* Stores neural states locally in `~/.local/share/neurophone/` (never uploaded)
* Optionally uses Claude API for complex queries (you control this)

**What NeuroPhone does NOT do:**

* Upload sensor data to any server (unless you enable cloud fallback)
* Track you or collect analytics
* Access camera, microphone, contacts, or personal data

**You control everything:** cloud fallback toggle, all config in `~/.config/neurophone/`, uninstall anytime.
====

=== After Install

Once your AI finishes setup, just use it:

[source,bash]
----
neurophone                                       # Start NeuroPhone
neurophone query "What am I doing right now?"    # Ask a question
neurophone status                                # Check system status
----

=== Uninstall

Tell your AI: "Uninstall NeuroPhone from my phone"

=== Troubleshooting

Tell your AI what went wrong -- it can read the troubleshooting docs in this repo. Common issues:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Problem |Solution

|"Termux not found"
|AI will guide you to install from F-Droid (NOT Google Play)

|Build takes too long
|Normal for first build (5-10 min). AI adjusts thread count for your device.

|"Model download failed"
|AI will try alternate download methods or suggest `adb push` from PC

|"LSM crashes"
|Low RAM. AI will reduce model size or neuron count for your device.

== What This Is

**neurophone** is a complete *Android application* for neurosymbolic AI on mobile devices. It combines spiking neural networks with large language models for on-device intelligence.

IMPORTANT: This is an *application*, NOT a library. For the underlying platform-agnostic routing library, see link:https://github.com/hyperpolymath/heterogenous-mobile-computing[mobile-ai-orchestrator].

== Target Device

Primary target: **Oppo Reno 13** (MediaTek Dimensity 8350)

* 12GB RAM
* NPU acceleration available
* Android 14+

Also compatible with Android 8.0+ devices with 4GB+ RAM.

== Core Purpose
